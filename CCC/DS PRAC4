PRACTICAL NO 4
AIM : Hypothesis Testing 
Formulate null and alternative hypotheses for a given problem. 
Conduct a hypothesis test using appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test, chisquare test). 
Interpret the results and draw conclusions based on the test outcomes

INPUT:
import scipy.stats as stats
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Formulate Hypotheses
# Null Hypothesis (H0): The sample mean is equal to the population mean
# Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The sample mean is different from the population mean

population_mean = 50  # Assume known population mean
sample_data = [45, 55, 52, 48, 49, 51, 53, 47, 54, 50]  # Sample dataset

# Step 2: Conduct Hypothesis Test (One-Sample t-test)
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(sample_data, population_mean)

# Step 3: Interpret the results
alpha = 0.05  # Significance level
print(f"Test Statistic: {t_stat:.4f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis: The sample mean is significantly different from the population mean.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: No significant difference between sample mean and population mean.")

OUTPUT:
